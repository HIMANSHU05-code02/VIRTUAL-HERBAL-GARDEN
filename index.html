          <h1>Aloe Vera</h1>
        </header>
        <p><strong>Common Names:</strong> Aloe</p>
        <p><strong>Latin Names:</strong> Aloe vera, Aloe africana, Aloe arborescens, Aloe barbadensis</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Aloe is a cactus-like plant found in hot, dry climates. It's cultivated in subtropical regions, including southern Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Historically, aloe has been used for skin conditions, baldness, and wound healing.
        </p>
        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>
          Aloe is applied topically for acne, lichen planus, burns, and radiation-induced skin damage. Orally, it’s promoted for weight loss, diabetes, hepatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis).
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2002, the U.S. FDA required the removal of aloe from over-the-counter laxatives due to insufficient safety data.
        </p>
        <h2>Research Insights</h2>
        <p>
          Studies suggest aloe gel applied twice daily can improve acne and speed burn healing. Evidence also shows it may reduce pain from burns and help with conditions like herpes simplex, lichen planus, and psoriasis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oral aloe vera shows mixed results for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and ulcerative colitis. In one study, 44% of colitis patients treated with aloe improved, compared to 14% on a placebo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research on diabetic foot ulcers and dental plaque shows promise but requires more clinical trials.
        </p>
        <h2>Safety Information</h2>
        <p>
          Topical use is generally safe but may cause occasional burning, itching, or eczema. Oral aloe latex can cause cramps, and long-term use has been linked to acute hepatitis in some cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animal studies linked oral aloe vera leaf extract to gastrointestinal cancer in rats, though more research is needed to confirm relevance to humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overuse of aloe latex may interact with heart medications like digoxin. Oral consumption during pregnancy or breastfeeding may be unsafe.
